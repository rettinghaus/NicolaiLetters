# The Letters of Otto Nicolai

Here I provide a list of letters written by Otto Nicolai, which has been published originally in my thesis "Studien zum geistlichen Werk Otto Nicolais" which can be found here: http://dx.doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-4210

The original CSV has been converted into [CMIF](https://github.com/TEI-Correspondence-SIG/CMIF/) with [csv2cmi](https://github.com/saw-leipzig/csv2cmi).
