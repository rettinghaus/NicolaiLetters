Here I provide a list of letters written by Otto Nicolai, which has been originally published in my thesis "Studien zum geistlichen Werk Otto Nicolais" which can be found here:

The list is being updated from time to time.

The original CSV has been converted into [CMIF](https://github.com/TEI-Correspondence-SIG/CMIF/) with [csv2cmi](https://github.com/saw-leipzig/csv2cmi).

In addition you'll find here some edited letters with more eventually to come. Stay tuned!
